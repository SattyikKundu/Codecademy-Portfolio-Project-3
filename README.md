## II. Tech Stack

- **React**           â€” used 'react-scripts' for frontend development.
- **Netlify**         â€” used for public deployment of the app.
- **Spotify Web API** â€” used to access user's Spotify account for authentication (OAuth with PKCE flow), searching tracks, and uploading created playlist. 
- **CSS**             â€” used for styling purposes.
- **React hooks**     â€” used `useState` and `useEffect` for local state management and effects triggering, respectively, in react app.
- **LocalStorage**    â€” used for storage and handling of authentication token (will upgrade to httpOnly cookie later on).

## IV. Limitations (Important)

- Spotify API restrictions prevent public use of the app until approved for production.
- Only the developer's Spotify account can currently log in.
- This limitation is due to a Spotify policy update (April 2025).
- For full use by others, Spotify requires:
  - Production request approval
  - A backend for secure token exchange (recommended)
